Sydney Housing Market Analysis Overview

This project analyzes the Sydney housing market to uncover pricing trends, affordability patterns, and Suburbs wise insights.
The analysis uses MySQL for data cleaning and querying, and Power BI for building interactive dashboards and visualizations.
The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end data analytics workflow — from cleaning raw data to actionable insights.


Objectives
- Analyze median property price trends over time
- Compare property prices across suburbs and distance from the CBD
- Examine affordability using income and price relationships
- Identify patterns by property type and dwelling characteristics
- Visualize insights in an interactive Power BI dashboard

Tools & Technologies
MySQL – data cleaning, joins, aggregations, and analysis
Power BI – data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboards
Data Visualization – trend, comparison, and distribution analysis

Dataset
- The dataset contains Sydney property listings and transaction data, including:
- Suburb and location information
- Median property prices
- Property type and dwelling attributes
- Income and affordability indicators

Data Cleaning & SQL Analysis
- Filter and clean raw property data
- Aggregate median prices by suburb, distance, and property type
- Calculate affordability ratios
- Prepare structured tables for visualization

All SQL queries are available in the sql/ folder.


Power BI Dashboard - The Power BI dashboard provides interactive insights including:
- Median price trends over time
- Property prices by distance from CBD
- Affordability analysis by suburb
- Median price by property type and dwelling size
- Price per square meter comparisons


Key Insights
- Properties closer to the CBD (0–10 km) command significantly higher median prices compared to outer suburbs.
- Median property prices show a general downward trend over time when adjusted for inflation.
- High-income suburbs are not always more affordable, indicating strong price pressure in premium areas.
- Certain suburbs exhibit extreme affordability ratios, highlighting potential investment or overvaluation zones.
- Property type has a strong influence on pricing, with blocks of units and development sites commanding higher median prices.


This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with raw real estate data
- Write analytical SQL queries
- Translate data into meaningful visual insights
- Build dashboards for decision-making rather than just reporting
